how it works?
cube is represented as six sides
  2
1 3 5 6
  4

1 green
2 white
3 red
4 yellow
5 blue
6 orange

1 is LEFT
2 is UP
3 is FRONT (FACING US)
4 is DOWN
5 is RIGHT
6 is BACK (away from us)

to rotate a side we: rotate that side by 90 degrees (transpose), then
we rotate the 4 connected faces
if we rotate 1, we are rotating 2346 left column
if we rotate 2, we rotate the top row of 1356
if we rotate 3, we rotate 1245 top
if we rotate 4: we are rotating 1356 bottom
if we rotate 5: we rotate 2346 right
if we rotate 6: we rotate rotate 1245 bottom

therefore:

if we rotate 1:
2L -> 3L -> 4L -> 6L
if we rotate 2:
1T -> 3T -> 5T -> 6T
if we rotate 3, then:
1R -> 2B -> 5L -> 4T
if we rotate 4:
1B -> 3B -> 5B -> 6B
if we rotate 5:
2R -> 3R -> 4R -> 6R
if we rotate 6:
1L -> 2T -> 5R -> 4B
